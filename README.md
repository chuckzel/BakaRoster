## Attributions

The project is originally forked from Microsoft's OneRoster Provider Demo and substantial parts of the code and this readme is based on it. The original repository for this demo has been deleted and the code seems not to be publicly accessible.

You can view the demo project [in this repository](https://github.com/chuckzel/BakaRoster/tree/ms-demo), before any changes were made.
